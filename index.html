  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  <h4>PG platinum</h4>               <h5>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Senior Manual/Automation QA &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   April 2022 – March 2024 </h5>
  <p>Working as a senior QA for a French event management company responsable for:
  <p>
    Created QA documentation from scratch, which had a great impact on the onboarding of new QA members and the automation of those test cases once they are added to zaphyre moving to the automation process was an easy task. 
Creating and executing API test automation Frameworks leveraging Postman and rest assured, for the purpose of increasing the coverage of the regression test executions enhancing deployent to production process from 25% test coverage to 80% coverage. 
Creating end to end auto test scenarios in order to test the integration of the new features with  the frontend and test of the old features. 
Which inhanced productivity, increased efficiency and reduced the time need to test the product and lower cycle time to deployment by 50%. 

Leveraging SQL and Bash, data integrity testing and getting real time test data from staging environment for more reliable close to real case sceanrios, was covered.

  <h4>City Falcon</h4>                         <h5>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Middle Manual/Automation QA &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   June 2019 – April 2022</h5>     
  
  <p> 
I started my tech career in this company it was more like home, than just a work place. I was responsible for the Financial Content department. With a sense of ownership I was responsible for the integrity of the data and the delivery time for each new feature. I have encountered lots of new technologies and new challenges every single day from automating react front-end app tests to API testing my first automation scenarios were there from API testing and response analysis as we had lots of data that needed verification and analysis not just a 200 ok response, running daily  SQL queries in order to test the integrity and the usability  of the data reviewing and testing the AI analysis tools, and how it handles data plus the integrity of the data delivered. 

My sense of ownership and the start up environment there allowed me to take over the responsibility of the project not just reporting bugs. Moving the requirements from a meeting to Epics and Stories into Jira to be developed by developers was not an easy task but I enjoyed it very much. 

Doing that reduced our delivery time and made us able to handle more challenges with faster pace, leveraging CI/CD and automation tests made us ready to compete with the biggest companies in the market as acquiring more clients for our Financial Content department. 
I was the first QA in this department so it was a build from scratch.
